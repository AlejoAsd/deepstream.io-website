## Why?
We love to see what people are building with deepstream. It can be a demo-app, open source project or fully fledged business application. The only condition is - there has to be something to see or talk about, e.g. Github Repo, website, video etc...

## How?
Just send us a mail at [info@deepstream.io](mailto:info@deepstream.io). Don't forget to include your t-shirt size, pick of Elton in his standard or party attire and shipping address.
