				<h2>Consulting</h2>

				<h2>Custom Development</h2>
				<p>Building your app is what you're best at. We'll leave that to you. But if you need help, we’d be happy to provide bespoke integrations with your internal systems, identity providers, messaging systems, databases and caches or create other features that help you make the most out of deepstream within your environment.</p>
				<ul class="benefits">
					<li>Integrations with existing system</li>
