Modern website analytic tools are fantastic. They show who’s visiting your site, where users come from, how they navigate your content and where they check out.

But what if you could have the same detailed insights for a physical store in a shopping mall? With Vivaspot you can.

The <> company from <> developed a technology that tracks user behaviour via Wifi-contacts. 
Even without any user-interaction or opt-in, smartphones constantly scan for available access points and provide anonymous, yet unique HMAC addresses. Vivaspot gathers this information to track movement and behaviour of customers on their shopping days.

To enhance the data, Vivaspot also gives merchants the ability to grant free wifi to their clients. Shoppers sign up with their email address and the anonymized data-point turns into a highly valuable, permanent shopper-id that can be linked to associated online-information, purchasing behaviour and movement patterns.

All this information is made available to participating merchants via realtime dashboards that provide detailed insights about their current and approaching customers.

A sizeable task
Shopping malls haven’t exactly gotten smaller in recent years. Larger centres like the Dubai Mall peak at well over 47 Million annual visitors and even smaller to medium sized outlets are frequented by hundreds of thousands of shoppers each day.

Tracking their movement and behaviour and relaying the right information to the right merchant is a monumental task - and Vivaspot needed a technology that could fit the bill. After moving out of Pub/Nub for cost-reasons and trying numerous alternatives, Vivaspot eventually discovered deepstream.

“Deepstream fit our requirements like Karma. It was meant to be”

Axxxxxx Bxxxxx, Vivaspot CTO

With close to ten-thousand data-points a second, Vivaspot needed a technology that was both reliable and fast - and deepstream’s event mechanism delivered just that. Customer information is streamed continuously to connected merchants, delivering details of up to 150 customers in the immediate vicinity at any given moment.


Time to Market
For a company with massive growth, quick turnaround times are key. Deepstream’s ease of use and wealth of out-of-the-box features enabled Vivaspot to go into production just three weeks after its adoption and has been reliably powering their system ever since. Its seamless integration with Amazon Web Service’s infrastructure made it a breeze to set up and plug into event streams and Lambda processing.

Having Partnered with Cisco and Miraki, opened a new office in Orlando, Florida and currently securing the next round of funding, Vivaspot is shaping up to become a cornerstone of physical customer behaviour analytics.

“We’re looking forward to extending our use of deesptream as our realtime data system grows” - said CTO aaaaa bbbb - “it’s data-sync capabilities and integrations with numerous databases make it a great solution for a range of different challenges we face.”
