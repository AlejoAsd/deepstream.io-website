cd ~/Downloads/deepstream.io-mac/
untar -xvf deepstream.io-mac
cd deepstream.io-mac
./deepstream.io-mac/deepstream start
```

## Starting deepstream
```bash
deepstream start

### Configuring deepstream
You can either change deepstream's [configuration file](/docs/server/configuration) directly in the `conf` directory.
